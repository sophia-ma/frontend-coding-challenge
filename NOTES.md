# Notes

This project has been done in 4 days, without any previous experience in Vue, Vuex and Vue Test Utils

Part 1: 
 Task 2: I stored the Goals as a comma-separated string because I saw you were doing the same in your official live survey

Part 2: 
 Task 1: 
    - I've also added a reset state action when we click the Start over button
    - Styling Guide: Based on the wireframe, the top medium - 80px margin has been applied but the component is being rendered inside a class 'survey-questions' where it has a padding-top and there isn't anything I can do apart from changing the template - which I didn't think I should

Part 3:
  - Not enough time to complete the sendToApi tests. I have left some commended code
